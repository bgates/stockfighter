# Starfighter (RIP)

This repo holds my solution attempts to a few of the problems from https://www.starfighters.io (warning: their SSL cert is expired as of 9/18/17). The idea behind that site was to offer coding challenges to developers as a way of evaluating talent. Unfortunately, the site died fairly quickly - the descriptions of the challenges are no longer available AFAIK. I'm putting this repo up because it's the most recent moderately complex Ruby code I've written.
